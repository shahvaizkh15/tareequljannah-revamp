						<h4 class="content-title">Giving Gifts to Teachers</h4>
						<ul>	
							<li>TareequlJannah understands that students would like to give gifts to their teachers for various occasions. Unfortunately, sending gifts overseas to Egypt can prove to be an expensive and untrustworthy process. Please read the policy below regarding gifts.</li>
							<li>TareequlJannah can ONLY accept monetary gifts from students to their teachers. Monetary gifts can be accepted with no monetary limit in the form of a personal check or money order. As soon as the monetary gift is received by TareequlJannah, a financial officer will forward the gift to the specified teacher.</li>

							<li>PLEASE specify the teacher's name to which the gift is for.</li>
							<li>Strictly, physical gifts cannot be accepted by TareequlJannah to be sent to teachers. Unfortunately, there are too many risks in sending and receiving gifts to Egypt that TareequlJannah does not allow such gifts to be sent.</li>
